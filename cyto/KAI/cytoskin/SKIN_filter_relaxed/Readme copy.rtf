\f0\fs24 \cf0 We change the filtering to quartile filter of outliers and make diff exp. on that then for underermened genes we insert very small value of expression(>40 cycles to detect)\
some of the interesting genes like interleukins have no signal in skin C and PNL skin samples.\
\
Hypothesis is that this genes have very low expression in the mentioned conditions and therefore individual experiments didn\'92t work out}
